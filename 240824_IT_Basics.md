- **API**: For applications to communicate with other applications programmatically to exchange information

- **Resources**: Information that different applications provide to their clients e.g. images, videos, text, numbers

- **Clients**: Person or a software system that want to access information from the web.

- **Server**: The machine that gives the resource to the client
  
- **REST**: Software architecture that imposes conditions on how an API should work to manage communication on a complex network like the internet. e.g. to access weather data from a weather system
  - **Uniform interface:** the server transfers information in a standard format. Requests should identify resources, to modify or delete the resource if they want to
  - **Representation:** The formatted resource e.g. the server can store data as text but send it in an HTML representation format.
  - **Benefits:**
    - Scalability, Flexibility, Independence
    - Easily implement and modify high-performing and reliable communication at scale.
    - Bring cross-platform portability to any API system. 

- **RESTful API**: APIs that follow the REST architectural style.

- **RESTful Web Services:**: Web services that implement REST architecture are called RESTful web services.

- **Statelessness:** Communication method in which the server completes every client request independently of all previous requests.
