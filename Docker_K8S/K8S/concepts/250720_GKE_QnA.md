- What is GKE? At a very high level, what problem does GKE (or Kubernetes in general) aim to solve for developers and operations teams?
- Why would someone choose to use GKE instead of just running their application directly on virtual machines? What's a key benefit?
- Imagine you have an application. How would you typically package and run it if you were going to deploy it on GKE? What's the fundamental unit of deployment?
- You mentioned that GKE takes care of "application hosting, its scalability (with a few configurations), networking, etc." Can you explain how GKE achieves scalability for your application without you manually intervening? What's the mechanism at play here?
- What is "Autopilot" mode in GKE, and how does it differ from "Standard" mode?
- You talked about packaging an application into a Docker image. Once that image is on GKE, how does GKE ensure that your application stays running and, if it fails, gets restarted automatically? What's the concept that manages this?
- Imagine you have multiple parts to your application â€“ maybe a web front-end and a separate database backend. How would you typically deploy these different parts within GKE so they can communicate with each other, but also remain somewhat isolated? What's a common GKE concept used for this logical grouping and communication?
- When you talk about deploying an application on GKE, you often hear the term "cluster." In simple terms, what is a GKE cluster made up of? What are its main components that work together?
- Imagine you've deployed your application to GKE. How would you make it accessible to users on the internet? What's the common GKE concept used to expose your application externally?
- Why is it generally recommended to containerize applications (e.g., with Docker) before deploying them to GKE? What key benefits does containerization provide in this context?
- You mentioned Horizontal Pod Autoscaling. How does GKE actually know when to scale your application? What information does it use to make that decision?
- When you update your application (e.g., a new version of your Docker image), how can you deploy this new version to GKE with minimal or no downtime for your users? What's the strategy often used for this?
- Besides managing applications, GKE also needs to manage its underlying infrastructure. How does GKE help you manage and maintain the virtual machines (nodes) that your applications run on, without you having to manually update them all the time?
- How does GKE manage communication between different parts of your application (services)?
- How do you secure applications running on GKE? What are some security features or best practices you are aware of?
- Can you explain how GKE integrates with other Google Cloud services and why this matters?
- What is a "Pod" in Kubernetes/GKE, and how is it different from a "container"?
- What is a "Deployment" in GKE, and why would you use it instead of just creating Pods directly?
- What are "Custom Resource Definitions" (CRDs) in GKE, and when might you use them?
