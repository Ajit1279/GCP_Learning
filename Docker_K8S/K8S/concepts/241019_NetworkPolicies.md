- Basics:
  - various resources within the cluster can communicate with each other using **CNI (Container Network Interface)**
  - There various CNI providers/plugins like weave-net, flannel, calico, cilium, kindnet as shown in the diagram
  - CNI creates a pod (say e.g. weave-net) in each node deployed as a deamonset
  - If we **intend front-end not to interact with database / storage layer directly**, we'll need to restrict that connection. This is where **network policies** come into picture
  - **Not all CNI plugins enforce Network policies e.g. flannel, kindnet**
  - To **disble "default" network policies**, we will need to **add networking.disableDefaultCNI = true**
