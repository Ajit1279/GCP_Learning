- Basics:
  - There are two types of autoscaling:
    - Horizontal: Multiple pods with the same specifications will be created.
    - Vertical: New pod with higher specifications is created. Useful for the non mission critical workloads

  - Event based autoscaling: e.g. when there are many 502 errors, using tools like KEDA
  - Cron / Schedule based autoscaling
