- **Daemonsets:**
  - In previous exercises multiple pods were created using Replicasets. The pods may or may not be created on three different pods.
  - On the contrary Daemonsets are created on each pod
  - e.g. Daemonset monitoring agent, logging agents, kubeproxy, weave-net, flannel, calico etc.   

- **Daemonset Demo**
  - Create daemonsetdemo.yaml
