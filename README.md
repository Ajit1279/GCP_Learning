- Close Billing Account:

  - This answer is for anyone who arrives at this question wanting to close a billing account and delete their credit card information from it. To delete all my 
    credit cards, I had to close my billing account first.

    Go to Billing (in the lefthand sidebar, or also https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) and choose the right billing account you want to close.
    Go to Billing > Account Management, and click the "X" on the top banner to close this billing account. https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-            billing-account#close_a_billing_account
    In Billing > Payment Method, remove your credit card.
    Before, I was trying to do 3 before 2, but I kept getting an error requiring another credit card be added. I had to do step 2, then 3 worked.
