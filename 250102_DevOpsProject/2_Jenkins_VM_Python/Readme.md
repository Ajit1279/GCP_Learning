- This exercise aims at creating a VM on GCP using Terraform script, install Python on it and execute a "Hello World" Python program on it.

- Follow [steps to create Jenkins Server](https://github.com/Ajit1279/GCP_Learning/tree/main/250102_DevOpsProject/1_Jenkins_on_GCPVM).

- If you face any error installing Jenkins follow answer from Timothy Godonu on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70541720/jenkins-has-no-installation-candidate-error-while-trying-to-install-jenkins-on)

- Created a Jenkinsfile so that [Jenkins](https://github.com/Ajit1279/GCP_Learning/blob/main/250102_DevOpsProject/2_Jenkins_VM_Python/Jenkinsfile) job is triggered only if there are changes in this directory, (Reference [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47600390/trigger-specific-jenkins-job-on-github-push-to-specific-directory)), but it didn't work. The Groovy script requires further analysis.

- In the meantime created a [new repository](https://github.com/Ajit1279/jenkins-pythonvm) and ran the Jenkins job but it's failing with authentication error.
