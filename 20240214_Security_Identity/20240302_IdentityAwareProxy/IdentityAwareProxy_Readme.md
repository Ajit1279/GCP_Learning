  - Establish **an application-level access control instead of network-level firewalls**.
  - A central **authorization** layer for applications accessed by **HTTPS**
  - The **fine-grained access controls implemented** by the product in use **without requiring a VPN**. 
  - A **resource** can only be **accessed through the proxy** by **principals who have the correct IAM role.** e.g. employees or contractors, or only a specific department.
  - **Scale across organization**: Define access policies centrally and apply them to all applications and resources.
  - IAP works with [signed headers](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/signed-headers-howto) or the App Engine standard environment [Users API](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/services/users?tab=python) to secure your app. 
  - **If IAP is enabled** for the app or backend service:
    - **information** about the protected resource (project number, request URL, any IAP credentials in request headers or cookies) is **sent to the IAP authentication server**.
    - IAP **checks user's browser credentials**.
      - **If valid**, those are **used to get the user's identity (email address and user ID) to check the user's IAM role and check if the user is authorized to access the resource**. 
    - **If none exist user is redirected to an OAuth 2.0 Google Account sign-in flow**
    - **If using Compute Engine or Google Kubernetes Engine**, **users** who can access the **application-serving port** of the Virtual Machine (VM) **can bypass IAP authentication**.
